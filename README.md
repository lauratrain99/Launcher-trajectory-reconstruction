# Launcher-trajectory-reconstruction
This repository pretends to show how to simulate a 6 DOF trajectory for a orbital launcher during its atmospheric phase using simple dynamics. It additionally includes the error characterization of a tactical-grade MEMS inertial IMU (STIM300 -Sensonor). The goal is to reconstruct the trajectory from the sensor simulated navigation data.
